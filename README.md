## Model-based analysis of virus particles

This repository is the code associated with the following publications:

Laine, R., Albecka, A., van de Linde, S. et al. Structural analysis of herpes simplex virus by optical super-resolution imaging. Nat Commun 6, 5980 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms6980


## What does it do?

Below is a flowchart of the analysis pipeline, allowing the extraction of strucural model parameters from imaging data. The work was focused on analysing dSTORM imaging of Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) but can be applied to any dataset for which the model may be appropriate.

## What did we get?

Here's a table summing up the results that we obtained in the paper. Showing extraction of protein layer radius and thickness with nanometer precision. We also observed that the type of labelling used impacted our results due to effect of linker size, which we could integrate in our model.
